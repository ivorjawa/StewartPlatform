### Algorithm
The point Pcoll is first chosen from the collective input.  The pitch vector Vp is the x axis rotated
around the y axis by the pitch input.  The roll vector Vr is the y axis rotated along the x axis by
the roll input.

The normal vector representing the plane of the rotor then Vr X Vx.

Then for each of the cylinder, the Mast X the vector from the orgin to the foot of the cylinder
is normal to the plane the cylinder can travel in.  The cross product of this vector and the rotor
plane vector is the vector of intersection of these two planes.  This vector is normalized and then
multiplied by radius R and added to Pc to locate the top point of the cylinder.

Finally, the length of the cylinder vector is checked to make sure it fits within the limits.
